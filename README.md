# Python Examples
These are my example files for the Python programming language, specifically Python 3.  

Python is one of my passion programming languages, and I have multiple projects and repositories
dedicated to Python code, stemming from Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms, to the projects I created for
the [College of Charleston](https://www.cofc.edu/)  

[Genetic Algorithms](https://github.com/balancedslate/AI_Examples/tree/main/Genetic%20Algorithms%20in%20Python)  
[Predator v. Prey Simulation](https://github.com/balancedslate/AI_Examples/blob/main/Genetic%20Algorithms%20in%20Python/pred_v_prey.py)  
[Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/balancedslate/AI_Examples/tree/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing)  
[Planetary Simulations](https://github.com/balancedslate/planetary_sims/tree/main/Planetary%20Simulations)  
[College Examples](https://github.com/balancedslate/python-examples/tree/main/PythonExamples)  
[Reddit Bot Templates](https://github.com/balancedslate/reddit_bots_example)  
[RESTFUL API Garden Example](https://github.com/balancedslate/restful-api-examples)  
[SQL/Database Examples](https://github.com/balancedslate/sql_examples/tree/main/SQL%20Examples)  

Please Enjoy.
